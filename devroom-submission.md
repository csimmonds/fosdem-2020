# Project details
## Title of devroom

Embedded, Mobile and Automotive

## Elaborate description of proposed devroom (including possible topics)

Embedded, Mobile and Automotive devroom used to be one of the most
popular devrooms in last couple of years. Unfortunately, in 2019 the
very long tradition of EMA devroom has been discontinued and the room
has not been organized. We aim at resurrecting and continuing this
awesome tradition.

The goal of this devroom is to showcase open source from embedded,
mobile and automotive areas.

Possible topics include:
* Hardware hacking
* FOSS in embedded programming
* The Linux Kernel
* FOSS in mobile area
* FOSS in automotive area

## Why does it fit FOSDEM?

Embedded, Mobile and Automotive industry heavily depends on
FOSS. There is so many related open source projects that it's almost
impossible to know them all. That's why we believe that knowledge
sharing is a main goal of this devroom.

The devroom used to be a great way of connecting open source
contributors from all related projects. Resurrecting the devroom will
attract low level programmers to visit the conference and allow us to
stimulate embedded community integration.
